 web-automation
 
 I have created an automation script with the help of #puppeteer and #javascript language which helps you getting notes of any subject you want.

How does it work?
This script will automate Noteshub which helps you in downloading required notes.
> It will take you to the interface for login into your Noteshub account.
> Then it will automatically take keyword entered by you for search.
> Now, it will download that particular notes/opens book for you in a pdf file.
